(// Debug purpose comments are present where debug draw can be uncommented).

How it work :
Wallrun is automatic when in air and near a wall.
Aim assist is like call of duty.

Controls :
Press 1 for switching wallrun enable.
Press 2 for switching wallrun enable.
( keys are displayed inder the UI)

UI :
Ability icon on the top.
Scoreboard on the top left.

Weird things :
No wallrun animation.
Wallrun logic only look at the hip of the player on the right and the left, would be better with more detection.
Wallrun does not stop if against a wall (90Â°).
Aim assist has a minimum range to avoid having the camera turning too fast.
When entering wallrun, the mumentum is kept until leaving the wallrun, I forget to reset it.
I also forget to replicate the projectile... (so it is called from client to server and not directly on the server).
I did not initialized and update scoreboard with new players (is supposed to be only 2 lines...) so it only display when someone is markking points.

Cool things :
Evrything is commented. (I forget to explain the architecture).
Wallrun jump.
Wallrun work with angled walls.
Smooth aim assist.

Also included :
Programmer art.
Ultra customisable parameters.
Everyone has the same name, so you can play among us at the same time.
